description: Get oriented on a GitHub issue and start developing it — from the branch you're already on, or from a number, link, or description you give directly. Reads the issue and its comments, follows any spike/decision it references, and makes sure you're on a linked branch before work begins. Use when asked to start, pick up, work on, or dev a specific GitHub issue.

# Starting work on a GitHub issue

Two ways in, one job either way: land on the right branch, then read enough to actually implement
the thing instead of guessing at it.

## 1. Find the issue

**Already on a branch for it.** Branch names from `pnpm issue:pick` (or step 2 below) look like
`feature/website/46-offline-issue-picker` — `<type>/<project>/<number>-<slug>`. Read the number off
`git branch --show-current` and confirm it with `gh issue view <number>` rather than trusting the
slug; slugs get hand-edited, numbers don't.

**Given a number, link, or description instead.** `gh issue view` takes either a bare number or a
full issue URL directly, so a `#46` or a pasted link needs no parsing. A plain description doesn't:

```sh
gh issue list --search "<the terms they gave you>"
```

Show the candidates and confirm the match before moving on — search is fuzzy, and starting work on
the wrong issue is expensive to notice later. Don't guess past one weak match.

## 2. Get on its branch

Skip this if step 1 already found you standing on the issue's branch.

Otherwise run `pnpm issue:pick` with the number. It asks nothing, and does what the interactive
pick does: builds `<type>/<project>/<number>-<slug>`, runs `gh issue develop --checkout` so the
branch is linked on the issue, self-assigns, and moves the issue to *In Progress*.

```sh
pnpm issue:pick <number>                                 # type from the label, board from the issue
pnpm issue:pick <number> --type=feature --title="Short"  # when the label or the title won't do
```

- **It fails rather than guessing** on a `spike` or an unmapped label (pass `--type=`) and on an
  issue with no board (pass `--project=<board title>`, after asking which). Ask the user when the
  message names a choice you can't settle from the issue.
- **The title becomes the slug**, so pass a shorter `--title=` when the issue title is long.
- **An existing branch for the number is checked out** instead of creating a second one, so
  resuming is the same command.
- A failed assignment or board move only warns; the branch is still checked out.

Check `git status --porcelain` first if you're not sure the tree is clean: the checkout carries
uncommitted changes over silently, which is usually fine but worth flagging before it happens.

## 3. Read the full context

One call gets the issue and everything it points at:

```sh
pnpm issue:brief            # on the issue's branch
pnpm issue:brief <number>   # anywhere else
```

It prints the body and every comment untrimmed — read past the body, the decision often lives in a
comment — then four sections, each a lookup you'd otherwise run by hand:

| Section | What to do with it |
| --- | --- |
| Blockers | Every `Blocked by #n`, with its title and state. For one that's closed, `pnpm issue:brief <n>` to learn what it settled, not just that it's done |
| Decisions | Reports in `docs/decisions/` whose frontmatter names this issue or one the thread mentions. Read every one before writing code on the same ground; a report on `status: to-implement` is the work you're about to do — its Result names the files, its Consequences the order and the tripwires, its Confirmation what to run at the end |
| Projects | The folders the issue touches, each with its `CLAUDE.md`. Read those, since Claude only loads a nested one once it reads a file there |
| Docs mentioned | Plans and guides the thread links. Read the ones the acceptance criteria lean on |

## 4. Confirm before diving in

Summarize back in a few lines: what the issue is asking for, anything a blocking issue or decision
record changes about the approach, and what you're about to do first. This is the cheap check that
you read the right thread before spending a session on it — not a full plan, just enough for the
user to redirect you if you picked up the wrong end of it.
